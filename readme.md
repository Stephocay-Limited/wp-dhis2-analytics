> Edition: February 2020

## Acknowledgement
DHIS2 Analytics is a WordPress Guttenberg Block plugin developed by Stephocay Limited with
financial support from Catholic Relief Services (CRS) through LogoicalOutcomes. The plugin is
developed to display DHIS2 dashboards within a WordPress page. Without the support from CRS
and technical guidance by LogicalOutcomes, this project would have been made possible. On
behalf of the project team, I would like to thank and pass a vote of thanks to all that have
contributed to this first version of the plugin and hopefully develop a community to support its
usage beyond its current state. Thanks to the dedicated software developers for making this
project a success.
